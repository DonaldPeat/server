To recap the SoC paradigm we've talked about (relatively standard in Spring): 

 - controller: concerned with I/O (receiving and responding to REST requests)
 - repository: concerned with persistence (loading and saving entities in the database)
 - entity: concerned with representing a domain object in the database 
 - service: concerned with executing the business logic of the domain
